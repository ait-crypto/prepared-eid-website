The AIT Austrian Institute of Technology is Austria's largest non-university research institute. With its seven Centers, AIT regards itself as a highly specialised research and development partner for industry. AIT provides research and technological development to realize basic innovations for the next generation of infrastructure related technologies in the fields of Energy, Low-Emission Transport, Health & Bioresources, Digital Safety & Security, Vision, Automation & Control and Technology Experience. These technological research areas are supplemented by the competence in the area of Innovation Systems & Policy.
            <p class="text">
            </p>
The AIT has about 1.450 employees working on the development of the tools, technologies and solutions for Austrian industries that are of utmost relevance for the future. The institute's Centre for Digital Safety & Security has over 200 experts developing state-of-the-art information and communication technologies to ensure that our systems are highly secure and reliable in the context of comprehensive digitization and global networking. The Centre focuses on key technology areas including: Distributed IT systems and the Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber Security for IT and Industrial Control Systems, State-of-the-art cryptographic methods (including Post Quantum Cryptography and Privacy-Enhancing Technologies) and Data Science, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Blockchain Technologies
            <p class="text">
            </p>
With this technological competence AIT addresses different markets, such as the semiconductor industry, the automotive sector, critical infrastructures such as energy network and power plant operators, financial markets, as well as the security sector in the context of critical infrastructure protection, environmental monitoring and crisis and disaster management. Strategic technology research is carried out in close cooperation with industry, science and the public sector, from the development of prototypes to the validation of applications.
            <p class="text">
Besides contributing to the research and development activities within PREPARED regarding post-quantum security and privacy, AIT is also leading the consortium as a project coordinator.
